Hi! I am Anik (he/him/his), a final year [IMPRS](https://www.imprs-astro.mpg.de/content/about-imprs-astrophysics.html) doctoral student in Astrophysics at the [University Observatory (USM)](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) München, Germany. I am advised by [Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/people/stella/stella.html) and work in the chair of [Extragalactic Astronomy](https://www.exgal.physik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at LMU led by [Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/).

My [research](research.md) focuses on weak gravitational lensing and cosmology. I work towards bridging theory and observations, specializing in the development of practical and theoretically tractable higher-order weak lensing statistics, (beyond traditional 2-point correlations) that have the potential to further enhance our knowledge on cosmological, astrophysical, and systematic parameters relative to 2-point only analyses.

Over the course of my research, I have been fortunate to work with my close collaborators [Alex Barreira](https://www.origins-cluster.de/forschung/origins-fellows/barreira), Alexandre Barthelemy, [Oliver Friedrich](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~oliverf/), Zhengyangguang Gong, and [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/contact-page/gruen.html).

I was born and brought up in the town of Durgapur in West Bengal, India. After graduating from high school, I moved to Bremen, Germany in order to pursue a BSc in Physics. During my undergraduate studies I interned at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology](https://www.ilt.fraunhofer.de/en.html), Aachen. I was also the recipient of the [DAAD RISE Worldwide](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-worldwide/) scholarship for two consecutive years which allowed me to pursue research internships in astronomy at [St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/) and [Tenerife](https://www.iac.es/en). These internships solidified my interest in astronomy. Subsequently, I relocated to Munich to pursue an MSc in Astrophysics. While working toward my master's degree, I also contributed part-time as a research assistant in the
Scientific Computing group of the [Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ)](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch/science-und-projects/project-coordination/scientific-computing.html), Garching and also at the University Observatory (USM). I have been in Munich since and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Astrophysics at LMU. For further details, please refer to my [CV](cv/AnikHalder_CV.pdf).

I love football and am a passionate supporter of [Arsenal FC](https://www.arsenal.com).
