Hi! I am Anik (he/him/his), a postdoctoral research associate at the Insitute of Astronomy [IoA](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/) and in the Kavli Institute for Cosmology, Cambridge. I am also affiliated to [Jesus College, as a College Postdoctoral Associate](https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/people/anik-halder).

My [research](research.md) focuses on galaxy formation and evolution and weak gravitational lensing cosmology. I work towards bridging theory and observations, specializing in the development, and analyses of practical, theoretically tractable *higher-order weak lensing statistics (beyond traditional 2-point correlations)* as well as *in the inference of physical properties of the millions of galaxies imaged in weak gravitational lensing datasets*. A core question that I spend a lot of my time currently thinking about is *how to do Bayesian cosmology cleanly with priors that we actually believe in (either physically motivated or data-driven or both)*.

<!-- Over the course of my research, I have been fortunate to work with my close collaborators [Alex Barreira](https://www.origins-cluster.de/forschung/origins-fellows/barreira), Alexandre Barthelemy, [Oliver Friedrich](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~oliverf/), Zhengyangguang Gong, and [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/contact-page/gruen.html).-->

I was born and raised in the town of Durgapur in West Bengal, India. After graduating from high school in 2014, I moved to Bremen, Germany to pursue a BSc in Physics. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology](https://www.ilt.fraunhofer.de/en.html), Aachen. I was also the recipient of the [DAAD RISE Worldwide](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-worldwide/) scholarship for two consecutive years which allowed me to pursue research internships in Astronomy at [St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/) and [Tenerife](https://www.iac.es/en) which solidified my interest in Astrophysics. Subsequently, I relocated to Munich to pursue an MSc in Astrophysics. While studying for my master's degree, I had the wonderful opportunity to work as a software developer at the
Scientific Computing group of the [Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ)](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch/science-und-projects/project-coordination/scientific-computing.html) and then as a research and teaching assistant in the Gravitational Lensing group at the University Observatory of LMU Munich. In 2024, I completed my PhD in Physics at LMU where I was advised by [Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/people/stella/stella.html) and [Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/). After my PhD, I moved to the University of Cambridge in November 2024 to start working as a postdoctoral research associate. I refer the reader to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HZm11dQAAAAJ&hl=en) profile for a list of publications that I am involved in or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anikhalder/) page for my CV.

I love walking, poetry and am a passionate supporter of [Arsenal FC](https://www.arsenal.com).
