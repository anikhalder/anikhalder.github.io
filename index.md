Hi! I am Anik (he/him), a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Institute of Astronomy (IoA)](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/) and at [Jesus College](https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/people/anik-halder) at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

My [research](research.md) focuses on galaxy formation and evolution and weak gravitational lensing cosmology. I work towards bridging theory and observations, specializing in the development, and analyses of practical, theoretically tractable *higher-order weak lensing statistics (beyond traditional 2-point correlations)* as well as *in the inference of physical properties of the millions of galaxies imaged in weak gravitational lensing datasets*. A core question that I spend a lot of my time currently thinking about is *how to do Bayesian cosmology cleanly with priors that we actually believe in (either physically motivated or data-driven or both)*.

<!-- Over the course of my research, I have been fortunate to work with my close collaborators [Alex Barreira](https://www.origins-cluster.de/forschung/origins-fellows/barreira), Alexandre Barthelemy, [Oliver Friedrich](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~oliverf/), Zhengyangguang Gong, and [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/contact-page/gruen.html).-->

I was born and raised in the town of Durgapur in West Bengal, India. After graduating from high school in 2014, I moved to Bremen, Germany to pursue a BSc in Physics. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology](https://www.ilt.fraunhofer.de/en.html), Aachen. I was also the recipient of the [DAAD RISE Worldwide](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-worldwide/) scholarship for two consecutive years which allowed me to pursue research internships in Astronomy at [St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/) and [Tenerife](https://www.iac.es/en) which started my research journey in Astrophysics. After finishing my undergraduate studies in Bremen, I hence relocated to Munich to pursue an MSc in Astrophysics. While studying for my master's degree, I had the wonderful opportunities to work part-time as a software developer at the
Scientific Computing group of the [Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ)](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch/science-und-projects/project-coordination/scientific-computing.html) and then as a research and teaching assistant in the Gravitational Lensing group at the University Observatory of LMU Munich. In 2024, I completed my PhD in Physics at LMU where I was advised by [Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/people/stella/stella.html) and [Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/). After my PhD, I moved to Cambridge in November 2024 to start working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. I refer the reader to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HZm11dQAAAAJ&hl=en) profile for a list of publications that I am involved in or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anikhalder/) page for my CV.

Besides exploring the nature of physical reality through my research, I work as a voluntary cafe retailer at the [Meadows Community Centre](https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/meadows-community-centre) run by the [Royal Voluntary Service](https://www.royalvoluntaryservice.org.uk/). I love poetry (recitation mainly; haven't tried my hand at writing), am a passionate supporter of [Arsenal FC](https://www.arsenal.com) and I love walking (upwards 12k steps per day). Since January 2025, I started tracking the total number of kms I have covered on foot (including everyday walks in and around the city, on holidays, during walking pilgrimages etc.). At the time of writing this sentence (July 20th 2025), my distance tracking app tells me that I have covered ~2,050 kms. Through such everyday *rambling*, I wish to walk the overall circumference of our planet (~40,075 kms) and beyond, in the years to come.
