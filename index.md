Hi! I am Anik, a final year doctoral student in astrophysics at the [Observatory](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) of the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) Munich, Germany. 
I am advised by [Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/people/stella/stella.html) and work in the chair of [Extragalactic Astronomy](https://www.exgal.physik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) and the [Optical and Interpretative Astronomy (OPINAS)](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/opinas-en) group at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics led by [Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/). My research focus is on weak gravitational lensing and cosmology. 
Specifically, I work at the interface of theory and data and focus on the development of novel and practical higher-order weak lensing statistics which can be easily measured from observational galaxy survey data. Complementing conventional analyses such as the weak lensing 2-point correlation functions with such higher-order statistics holds the potential to bring significant improvements on the constraints of cosmological as well as astophysical and systematic parameters.
