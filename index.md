Hi! I am Anik (he/him), a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the [Institute of Astronomy (IoA)](https://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/) and at [Jesus College](https://www.jesus.cam.ac.uk/people/anik-halder) at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

My [research](research.md) focuses on galaxy formation and evolution and weak gravitational lensing cosmology. I work towards bridging theory and observations, specializing in the development, and analyses of practical, theoretically tractable *higher-order weak lensing statistics (beyond traditional 2-point correlations)* as well as *in the inference of physical properties of the millions of galaxies imaged in weak gravitational lensing datasets*.

I was born and raised in the town of Durgapur in West Bengal, India. After graduating from high school in 2014, I moved to Bremen, Germany to pursue a BSc in Physics. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology](https://www.ilt.fraunhofer.de/en.html), Aachen. I was also the recipient of the [DAAD RISE Worldwide](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-worldwide/) scholarship for two consecutive years which allowed me to pursue research internships in Astronomy at [St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/) and [Tenerife](https://www.iac.es/en) which started my research journey in Astrophysics. After finishing my undergraduate studies in Bremen, I relocated to Munich in 2017 to pursue an MSc in Astrophysics. During that time, I worked as a software developer at the Scientific Computing group of the [Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ)](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch/science-und-projects/project-coordination/scientific-computing.html) and as a research and teaching assistant in the Gravitational Lensing group at the [University Observatory](https://www.physik.lmu.de/observatory/en/) of LMU Munich. In 2024, I completed my PhD in Physics at LMU where I was advised by [Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/people/stella/stella.html) and [Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/). After my PhD, I moved to Cambridge in November 2024 to start working as a Postdoctoral Research Associate. I refer the reader to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HZm11dQAAAAJ&hl=en) profile for a list of publications that I am involved in or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anikhalder/) page for my CV.

Besides exploring the nature of physical reality through my research, I love poetry (recitation mainly; haven't tried my hand at writing), am a passionate supporter of [Arsenal FC](https://www.arsenal.com) and I love walking!
