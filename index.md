Hi! I am Anik, a final year doctoral student in astrophysics at the [Observatory (USM)](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/) of the Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU) Munich, Germany. I am advised by [Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/people/stella/stella.html) and work in the chair of [Extragalactic Astronomy](https://www.exgal.physik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at LMU led by [Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/). I am also affiliated with the [OPINAS](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/opinas-en) research group at the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics (MPE), Garching, Germany. Â 

My research focus is on weak gravitational lensing and cosmology. Specifically, I work at the interface of theory and observations and focus on the development of novel and practical higher-order weak lensing statistics (beyond conventional 2-point correlations) that can be easily measured from galaxy survey data and which hold the potential to bring significant improvements on the constraints of cosmological as well as astrophysical and systematic parameters.  

In Munich, I have been fortunate to work closely with my collaborators [Alex Barreira](https://www.origins-cluster.de/forschung/origins-fellows/barreira), Alexandre Barthelemy, [Oliver Friedrich](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~oliverf/), Zhengyangguang Gong, and [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/contact-page/gruen.html).
