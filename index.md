Hi! I am Anik (he/him/his), a postdoctoral researcher in the [OPINAS](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/opinas-en) group of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics and am based at the [University Observatory](https://www.usm.uni-muenchen.de/index_en.php) of the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) München, Germany.

My [research](research.md) focuses on weak gravitational lensing and cosmology. I work towards bridging theory and observations, specializing in the development and application of practical, theoretically tractable higher-order weak lensing statistics (beyond traditional 2-point correlations) leveraging state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence methods to enhance further our knowledge on cosmological, astrophysical, and systematic parameters relative to 2-point only analyses.

<!-- Over the course of my research, I have been fortunate to work with my close collaborators [Alex Barreira](https://www.origins-cluster.de/forschung/origins-fellows/barreira), Alexandre Barthelemy, [Oliver Friedrich](https://www.usm.lmu.de/~oliverf/), Zhengyangguang Gong, and [Daniel Gruen](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/about-us/people/contact-page/gruen.html).-->

I was born and raised in the town of Durgapur in West Bengal, India. After graduating from high school, I moved to Bremen, Germany to pursue a BSc in Physics. During my undergraduate studies, I interned at the [Fraunhofer Institute for Laser Technology](https://www.ilt.fraunhofer.de/en.html), Aachen. I was also the recipient of the [DAAD RISE Worldwide](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-worldwide/) scholarship for two consecutive years which allowed me to pursue research internships in astronomy at [St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/) and [Tenerife](https://www.iac.es/en). These internships solidified my interest in astronomy. Subsequently, I relocated to Munich to pursue an MSc in Astrophysics. While working toward my master's degree, I also contributed as a research assistant in the
Scientific Computing group of the [Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ)](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch/science-und-projects/project-coordination/scientific-computing.html), Garching and also at the University Observatory (USM). In February 2024, I completed my PhD in Physics at LMU where I was advised by [Stella Seitz](https://www.usm.lmu.de/people/stella/stella.html) and [Ralf Bender](https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~bender/). For further details, please refer to my [CV](cv/AnikHalder_CV.pdf).

I love football and am a passionate supporter of [Arsenal FC](https://www.arsenal.com).
