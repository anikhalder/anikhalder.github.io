title: Bio

I was born and brought up in the town of Durgapur in West Bengal, India. After graduating from high school, I moved to Bremen, Germany in order to pursue my Bachelor in Physics.
During my undergraduate studies, I was the recipient of the [DAAD RISE Worldwide](https://www.daad.de/rise/en/rise-worldwide/) scholarship for two consecutive years which 
allowed me to pursue internships in astronomy at [St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/about/), Scotland and in [Tenerife](https://www.iac.es/en), Spain.
The internships solidified my interest in astronomy and after obtaining my Bachelors, I moved to Munich, Germany to pursue a Masters in Astrophysics. 
During my graduate studies, I worked part-time as a software developer in the
[Scientific Computing research group of the Heinz Maier-Leibnitz Zentrum (MLZ)](https://mlz-garching.de/englisch/science-und-projects/project-coordination/scientific-computing.html), Garching.
I have been in Munich since and am currently pursuing my PhD in Astrophysics at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich. For more details please refer to my CV.

I love football and am a loyal supporter of Arsenal FC.
