## The integrated 3-point correlation function of projected cosmic density fields

In this series of works we have developed a set of practical higher-order statistics called the *integrated 3-point correlation functions* which can be easily measured from galaxy imaging data alongside conventional 2-point statistical methods and has the potential to put tighter constraints on cosmological, galaxy bias as well as baryonic feedback parameters. This statistic measures the correlation of the *position-dependent* 2-point correlation functions of a field (e.g. 3x2 point galaxy-lensing correlations) inside a local 2D patch with the 1-point average shear or galaxy density field within the same patch. This correlation admits a very well-defined physical interpretation as the modulation of the small-scale 2PCFs by long-wavelength features of the field and in turn is sensitive to the higher-order squeezed bispectrum configurations (3-point function) of the field. Using semi-analytical methods based on perturbation theory for accurately modelling this statistic along with the inclusion of galaxy bias, intrinsic alignments, baryonic feedback effects as well as other nuisance parameters, we have extensively validated our models against simulations and with state-of-the art machine learning neural networks developed fast inference pipelines for their application to galaxy survey data. We are currently analysing this statistic in the Dark Energy Survey's Year 3 data.
