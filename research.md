## The integrated 3-point correlation function of projected cosmic density fields

In this series of works we have developed a set of practical higher-order statistics called the integrated 3-point correlation functions which can be easily measured from galaxy imaging data to complement conventional 2-point statistical analyses and with the potential to put tighter constraints on cosmological, galaxy bias as well as baryonic feedback parameters. This statistic measures the correlation of the *position-dependent* 2-point correlation function of a field (e.g. weak lensing cosmic shear) inside a local 2D patch with the mean field within the same patch. This admits a very well-defined physical interpretation as the modulation of the small-scale 2PCF by long-wavelength features of the field and in turn is sensitive to the squeezed bispectrum configurations of the field. With analytical methods based on perturbation theory for accurately modelling this statistic along with the inclusion of astrophysical as well as nuisance parameters, we have extensively validated our models against simulations and with state-of-the art machine learning neural networks developed fast inference pipelines for application of these statistics to galaxy survey data.
